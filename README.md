PressBooks
==========

This is [MobiApp121 Publishing's](http://mobiapp121.com/publishing/) development version of [PressBooks](http://pressbooks.com), a book content management system which exports in multiple formats: ebooks, webbooks, print-ready [PDF][], and various XML flavours. [MobiApp121 Publishing](http://mobiapp121.com/publishing/) are developing and using PressBooks to provide a supporting services/showcase platform for their range of eBook and Publishing services. There are some small changes (so far) to include a Drop Cap plugin, Apple iBook xml for ePub and TinyMCE compatibility for certain server setups.

[PressBooks](http://pressbooks.com) is built on top of WordPress Multi-Site, and makes significant changes to:
  * admin interface (customized for books and other structured documents, such as magazines, journals, reports etc.)
  * web presentation layer (again, customized for books and structured documents); and 
  * export routines. 

PressBooks is free software, released under the GPL v.2.0 license. 

Our web/ebook and [PDF][] exports are all driven by HTML+CSS. XML outputs have no styling.

  [PDF]: http://pressbooks.com/prince        "Note: we use the non-free software Prince XML for PDF export."
  
  Mobiapp121 is developing a free PDF alternative which will be added to this repository as soon as possible.
